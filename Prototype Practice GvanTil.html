	<h1>Working on prototypes with Saan!</h1>
	<script type="text/javascript">

		// - Create a new class called EmailList. The constructor function should take in one parameter, "name", and return an instance which contains the following:
		// - name, the name of the mailing list, such as "BSSA Students" or "BSSA Teachers".
		// - list, an array of all the emails in that list. Note that initially, the array will be empty.
		
		function EmailList (name){
			this.name = name;
			this.list = [];
		};

		var BSSA = new EmailList ("BSSA students");
		var Teachers = new EmailList ("BSSA teachers")

		
		// - Add a function to the EmailList's prototype. This function should be called "addEmail", and it should take one parameter, an email address and add it to the "list" property of the instance.

		EmailList.prototype.addEmail = function(mailadress){
			this.list.push(mailadress)
		};
		BSSA.addEmail("mail@mail.com")
		BSSA.addEmail("gijs@mail.com")
		BSSA.addEmail("kyle@mail.com")

		console.log(BSSA.list)
		console.log(BSSA)

		// - Add another function to the EmailList's prototype, called "sendEmailToAll". This function should take in one parameter: the text of the email, and then "send an email to each address". Since that lecture will be sometime in week 6, for now, simply print out the following:
		// 		"Email content:"
		// <list the text of the email to be sent>

		// "Sending email to:"
		// <list all email addresses>


		EmailList.prototype.sendEmailToAll = function (text){
			document.write ("Email content: <br> " + text + "</br>" + "</br>")
			document.write ("sending email to:" + "</br>")
			for (var person = 0; person < this.list.length; person ++) {
				document.write(this.list[person] + "</br>")
			}
		}
			BSSA.sendEmailToAll("Hello All I hope to launch my first website in weeks");
